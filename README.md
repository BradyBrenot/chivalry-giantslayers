=====================

Experimental Giant Slayers branch. This is to be a more focused game, with a particular sight on asymmetrical, Mini vs. Maxi combat. Unlike GiantSlayers, this won't replace Chivalry game modes, won't easily work in existing Chivalry maps, and won't have Giant Slayers' same flow (growing from a small to a large size and all that); this is some sort of asymmetric co-op / counter co-op experiment. Let's see what happens.
